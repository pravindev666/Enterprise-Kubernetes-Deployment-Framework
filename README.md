# DevOps Engineer - Assignment

## Objective
To build and deploy a containerized application on **AWS** using **EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with an integrated **CI/CD pipeline** that includes **cold build, code deployment, and automated updates**.
A production-grade, cloud-native microservices platform demonstrating modern DevOps practices and enterprise deployment patterns. This project showcases the complete lifecycle of containerized application deployment—from infrastructure provisioning to automated CI/CD pipelines—on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
Key Achievement: Zero-downtime deployments with automated rollback capabilities and comprehensive observability.

## Use Case
Aivar is deploying a **microservices-based application** that needs to be **containerized, orchestrated, and automatically deployed** in **AWS EKS**. You will:

1. **Deploy an example application** (based on `hello-kubernetes`).
2. **Implement a CI/CD pipeline** with **cold builds, rolling deployments, and version management**.
3. **Set up monitoring, logging, and infrastructure as code** using **Terraform or CloudFormation**.

## Assignment Breakdown

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- **Provision an EKS Cluster** using **Terraform** or **AWS CloudFormation**.
- **Configure AWS IAM roles, security groups, and access policies** for Kubernetes.
- **Set up AWS ALB Ingress Controller** to expose services.

### 2. Containerization & Deployment
- **Fork and modify the `hello-kubernetes` repository** to include a new microservice (e.g., a Python **FastAPI** app).
- **Build a Docker image** and push it to **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**.
- **Deploy the application** to **EKS** using **Helm charts** or **Kubernetes manifests**.

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline with Code Build & Code Deploy

#### **Build Process (Cold Build)**
- Set up **GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins** to:
  - Trigger a **code build** when changes are pushed to the repo.
  - Build and tag the **Docker image** based on **Git commit hash** or **versioning**.
  - Push the image to **Amazon ECR**.

#### **Deployment Process (AWS CodeDeploy + Rolling Updates)**
- Use **AWS CodePipeline** to automate the **deployment flow**.
- Use **AWS CodeBuild** for building application artifacts.
- Deploy container updates using **AWS CodeDeploy** with a **rolling strategy**:
  - **Blue/Green deployment** (optional).
  - **Canary deployments** to test new versions before a full rollout.
  - **Rollback mechanism** in case of failure.

### 4. Monitoring & Logging
- **Set up Amazon CloudWatch** to track **logs and metrics**.
- **Use Prometheus & Grafana** for **real-time Kubernetes monitoring**.
- **Implement Fluentd** or **AWS CloudTrail** for application logs.
